    <h2>2. Surgical Strikes: A Strategic Military Response</h2>
    <p>On September 29, 2016, the Indian Army carried out surgical strikes across the Line of Control (LoC) in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. This was a response to the Uri attack, where 18 Indian soldiers were killed. The operation aimed to target militant camps and is considered one of India's most significant military actions in recent history.</p>
